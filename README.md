This is my first project with The Odin Project. I will be putting together everything I have learned about html, including organizing directories and files and adding links and images
Final reflection - I put into practice structuring a website using html, adding links and images(including a gif!), and using relative links. I also built some muscle memory for writing my boilerplate code
